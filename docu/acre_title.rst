ACRE is collection of PD-Patches, Externals and helping applications for 
algorithmic composition in an realtime computermusic environment. 
It was dedicated to be integrated in open source projects at Atelier 
Algorythmics AA_ or IEM_ und now is published to be used by others.

"development version" means in this context:
    Structure and namespaces of this library will change if necessary,
    ignoring backwards compatibility unless Version "1.x"  is reached.
    Until the "stable" version 1.0 is reached, modules already used  and tested in 
    various projects will be added, so this lib can grow in next month often.
